    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>Our normative models were developed using advanced statistical techniques including:</p>
    <p>• <strong>Generalized Additive Models (GAMs):</strong> For capturing non-linear age effects</p>
    <p>• <strong>Multiple Regression:</strong> For modeling demographic predictors</p>
    <p>• <strong>Quantile Regression:</strong> For generating percentile-based norms</p>
    <p>• <strong>Cross-validation:</strong> For model validation and parameter optimization</p>
    
    <h3>Data Sources</h3>
    <p>The normative data is derived from a comprehensive dataset of cognitive assessments from healthy participants across multiple research sites. All data has been anonymized and aggregated to protect participant privacy while maintaining statistical power.</p>
    <p><strong>Sample Characteristics:</strong></p>
    <p>• Age range: 18-90 years</p>
    <p>• Education: 8-25 years</p>
    <p>• Gender balanced samples</p>
    <p>• Multiple cultural and linguistic backgrounds</p>
    
    <h3>Model Validation</h3>
    <p>Each normative model underwent rigorous validation using:</p>
    <p>• <strong>Cross-validation:</strong> 10-fold cross-validation for all models</p>
    <p>• <strong>Independent test sets:</strong> 20% holdout samples for final validation</p>
    <p>• <strong>External validation:</strong> Testing on independent research cohorts</p>
    <p>• <strong>Clinical validation:</strong> Comparison with known clinical groups</p>
    
    <h3>Chart Descriptions</h3>
    <p><strong>Age vs Performance:</strong> Displays the relationship between participant age and raw cognitive performance scores. Shows age-related changes and identifies optimal age ranges for each measure.</p>
    <p><strong>Education vs Performance:</strong> Illustrates how years of formal education correlate with cognitive performance, helping account for educational effects in normative scoring.</p>
    <p><strong>Model Residuals:</strong> Shows the residuals from the fitted normative model, helping identify potential outliers or model limitations. Well-fitted models show randomly distributed residuals.</p>
    <p><strong>Predicted vs Actual:</strong> Compares model predictions against observed scores. Points along the diagonal indicate good model fit, while deviations suggest areas for model improvement.</p>
    
    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
    <p>This dashboard uses modern web technologies for optimal performance:</p>
    <p>• <strong>Plotly.js:</strong> For interactive, publication-quality visualizations</p>
    <p>• <strong>JavaScript ES6+:</strong> For modular, maintainable code architecture</p>
    <p>• <strong>Responsive CSS:</strong> For cross-device compatibility</p>
    <p>• <strong>Client-side processing:</strong> For fast, secure data interaction</p>
    
    <h3>Data Export Options</h3>
    <p><strong>Export Data:</strong> Downloads the underlying data in JSON format for further analysis.</p>
    <p><strong>Export Model:</strong> Provides model parameters and metadata for reproducibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Export Images:</strong> Generates high-resolution PNG images suitable for publications.</p>
