    <h3>About This Dashboard</h3>
    <p>This interactive dashboard presents normative models for various cognitive measures. Our research has developed normative models that account for demographic variables and provide standardized reference points for cognitive assessment.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Use</h3>
    <p>Select a cognitive measure from the left sidebar to view interactive visualizations. Each measure displays four coordinated charts showing different aspects of the normative model. Hover over data points to see detailed information and observe how the same subjects are highlighted across all charts.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <p><strong>Cross-Chart Highlighting:</strong> Hover over any data point to see the same subject highlighted across all four visualizations simultaneously.</p>
    <p><strong>Export Functionality:</strong> Download data, model parameters, and high-resolution images for publications.</p>
    <p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-time Analysis:</strong> Explore normative data interactively without needing specialized software.</p>
    
    <h3>Research Background</h3>
    <p>These normative models were developed as part of ongoing research into cognitive assessment standardization. The models account for demographic factors and provide clinically relevant reference points for cognitive performance evaluation.</p>
    
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>Click on any cognitive measure in the sidebar to begin exploring the normative data. Each visualization provides a different perspective on the relationship between demographic variables and cognitive performance.</p>
